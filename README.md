# lifetimeSim
Geant4 Simulation of the 14N(p,g) lifetime measurement experiment

This project is the source code for the Geant4 Simulation. 
In order to run, must create a build directory and make the project. 
This is done outside the scope of the github repository. 

Initial project contains only the HPGe detector. 
Subsequent changes are adding in the target and target chamber. 
From there, changing the physics in order to simulate the 15O and its decay.
